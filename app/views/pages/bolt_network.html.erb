        <p>Bolt Network is an on-going attempt to reverse engineer Netflix's front end. What began
        as a practice project on Codecademy is now a large application with 80 movie objects that 
        uses Ruby algorithms, complex JavaScript effects, and serves images from Amazon S3. My 
        additions include an animated, fixed navbar, a main slideshow scaled to browser width with 
        jQuery, an animated search form using Regexp, and CSS3-animated carousel sliders built with 
        Ruby and a modified version of Unslider. Using Bootstrap, jQuery, and my own break-point 
        mixins, the views adapt to browser width to display elegantly on any device.</p>

        <p>I completed the overhaul of Bolt Network over a month from mid-April to mid-May, 2016. This 
        was an experimental project with several learning goals in mind. Having completed serveral algorithm 
        challenges on HackerRank, I wanted to see how I could use Ruby and JavaScript to make this app more 
        responsive and interactive. In the process, I arrived at the goal of re-creating Netflix's front end. 
        As the project is on-going, I expect to make future improvements such as swapping out Unslider for 
        a custom carousel that will more accurately depict Netflix effects. I already have ideas on how to do 
        it so watch this space!</p>

          <div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-1 text-center">

        <h2>Main Slideshow</h2>

        <%= image_tag("bolt-network-home-new.png", class: "img-responsive") %>

        <p>The main slideshow is built on Vegas.js with custom scripts for altering content 
        and scaling to browser width. At the moment, the content div is set to 18em and the 
        slider height adjusts to 200px less than the browser width. Content text is set to 
        scale at 0.014% of browser width. I intend to adjust the content scaling in future 
        versions to resize in a smoother, less noticeable way.</p>
