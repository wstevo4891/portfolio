        <p>Bolt Network is a highly modified version of a practice project on Codecademy. It is 
        built to look and behave like Netflix short of streaming copyrighted videos. My 
        additions include dynamically loaded content, a slideshow scaled to browser width 
        with jQuery, an animated search form, a fully ajaxified Genres Table, and a custom fixed 
        navbar. Using Bootstrap and jQuery, the views adapt to browser width to display elegantly 
        on any device.</p>

        <p>I completed the overhaul of Bolt Network within two weeks in March and early April, 2016. This 
        was an experimental project with several learning goals in mind. Having completed many algorithm 
        challenges on HackerRank, I wanted to see how I could use Ruby to make this app more responsive and 
        interactive. In the process, I also figured out how to perform all CRUD actions with AJAX and create 
        a simple search form. As the project is on-going, I expect to make future improvements such as a 
        slideshow in the banner and an asynchronous search function using regular expressions.</p>
