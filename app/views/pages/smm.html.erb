        <p>Sherry Matthews Marketing, a group of sales representatives in the
        housewares industry, needed a website for their company. The client
        wanted something simple to mainly display images of products and link
        to the manufacturers' websites.</p>

        <h4>My Responsiblities</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Building the entire website from scratch</li>
          <li>Implementing the client's preferred design with CSS</li>
          <li>Integrating and customizing a slideshow of the product lines 
          and images of the showroom and employees</li>
          <li>Deploying the site on GoDaddy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This was my first website project, which I worked on while helping
        the company as a sales rep at shows. We began in April, 2014 and went
        through several designs before the client settled on one she liked. My
        greatest challenge by far was the slideshow, but I pulled through. I've
        been the webmaster ever since and make updates to the site as
        requested.</p>
